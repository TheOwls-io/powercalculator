This is a Vuejs component to help decide how long you should run your experiment.

# Instalation
To build the files you will need [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/).

Then you can run ```$ npm install```.

When you want to build the component you will use ```$ rollup -c```.

You can change rollup.config.js if the current setup doesn't suit your needs.

We are creating a js and css output files. You need to add both to your project.
